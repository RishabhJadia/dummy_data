Today, I am going to narrate the story of Indian bollywood film named "Chak de india" and the film portrays the "Importance of team work"

I want to setup some context before proceeding with actual scene.

There is coach named kabir khan who doesn't hear or see states. he only know one named that is india.

So, what happened There is one girl named preeti who comes late at the first day of selection process and introduce herself as a state captain.

then coach said I am coach of Indian national womens hokey team and I will judge who is good player or bad player.

Coach asked all the players to introduce. They start introducing by doing same mistake first they called their name followed by state name.

So, he asked those players to step aside away from the team.

Suddenly, one player named "vidhya sharma" said his name and followed by Country name "India" then he asked speak loudly once more.
Then Coach said Thank You. You are in the team.

So mainly, What coach purpose was "they should play for their country first, then for their team members and if there is still some energy left, then for themselves."
